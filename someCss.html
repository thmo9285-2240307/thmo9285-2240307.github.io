        <font face = "Comic sans MS" size =" 5">From the Halls of Montezuma
            To the shores of Tripoli
            We fight our country's battles
            In the air, on land, and sea.
            First to fight for right and freedom
            And to keep our honor clean; We are proud to claim the title
            Of United States Marines.
            Our flag's unfurled to every breeze
            From dawn to setting sun; We have fought in every clime and place
            Where we could take a gun.
            In the snow of far-off Northern lands
            And in sunny tropic scenes; You will find us always on the job--The United States Marines.
            Here's health to you and to our Corps
            Which we are proud to serve; In many a strife we've fought for life
            And never lost our nerve.
            If the Army and the Navy
            Ever look on Heaven's scenes, They will find the streets are guarded
            By United States Marines. </font;><br
